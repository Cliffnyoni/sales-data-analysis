**Bar Sales Mock Data Analysis Project**

**Project Overview**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of mock sales data for a bar, focusing on volume, revenue, and profit margins across four key departments: Beer, Spirits, Wine, and Ciders. The goal is to identify high-performing products and provide data-driven strategic recommendations to optimize profitability.

**KEY FINDINGS**
1. **Departmental Performance**
Beer Dominance: Beer is the primary driver of the business, accounting for 60.8% of total sales volume.

**Spirit Margins**: The Spirits department currently has the lowest average margin at 61.15%, which is below the target performance levels seen in other categories.

2. **Top Performing Products**
Cider Can: A standout performer with a massive 90.43% profit margin, contributing nearly R1,900 in revenue.

Beer Concentration: Success in the Beer department is highly concentrated; just four brands (Brand B, Cider Can, Brand I, and Brand C) drive 73% of the department's total volume.

**Strategic Recommendations**
Based on the data analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve the shop's financial performance:

Protect Beer Volume: Ensure that the top 4 brands (Brand B, Cider Can, Brand I, Brand C) are always in stock to maintain the core revenue stream.

Reposition Spirits: Transition away from low-margin spirits that drag down the category average. Introduce premium bottles to aim for a 68-70% margin range, consistent with Beer and Wine.

Capitalize on Ciders: Use the high profitability of the "Cider Can" by implementing "buy 2" promotions or improving shelf placement to increase volume for this high-margin item.

**Tools Used**
Jupyter Notebook: For data processing and visualization.

Python/Pandas: Used for data manipulation and calculating departmental metrics.
